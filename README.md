Project: Efficiency and Performance Enhancements

Overview

This project focuses on achieving significant improvements in efficiency and development processes using a variety of modern technologies such as Java, Python, Node.js, Spring Boot, Kubernetes, and Docker. The overall goal was to reduce development time, optimize database performance, and enhance system scalability and security.

Key Achievements

	•	20% Efficiency Increase & 15% Development Time Reduction:
By actively participating in all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) under Scrum Agile methodology, the project achieved notable performance improvements, shortening the overall development cycle.
	•	Account Management System with Eureka Discovery Server:
Implemented a Eureka discovery server for account management using a technology stack consisting of Java, Python, and Node.js, resulting in a 20% enhancement in system efficiency.
	•	Database Efficiency Boost by 40%:
Leveraged Spring annotations and JPA dependencies to optimize database operations and improve query performance on MySQL and SQL Server.
	•	20% Decrease in Processing Time:
Optimized stored procedures and functions using PL/SQL and Java, resulting in a 20% reduction in data processing time through query tuning, indexing, and code refactoring.
	•	Scalability and Efficiency Enhancements:
Improved system scalability by mapping database routes and API routes within the Spring Cloud Gateway, contributing to increased efficiency.
	•	20% Surge in User Registrations:
Engineered secure user login and sign-up pages using Spring Boot Security, JWT, and OAuth2 for validation, resulting in a significant increase in user registrations and enhanced data security.
	•	Containerization & Orchestration with Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift:
Achieved a 20% efficiency increase in deployment and operational processes by utilizing containerization tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift.
	•	40% Improvement in Code Quality:
Improved code quality and accelerated bug identification by 40% through extensive unit testing using JUnit.

Step 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git

Step 2 Navigate to the project directory:
cd yourprojectname

Step 3 Set up the database:
	•	Configure MySQL or SQL Server as your primary database.
	•	Import necessary SQL scripts to create required tables and procedures.
 
Step 4.	Build and run the application:
	•	For Java/Spring Boot backend:
  ./mvnw spring-boot:run
  
Step 5 Run unit tests:
 ./mvnw test
 
Step 6 Deploy the application using Docker:
 docker-compose up
